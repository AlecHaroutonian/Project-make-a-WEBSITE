<p>DC:Despite the official names "National Comics" and "National Periodical Publications", the company began branding itself
as "Superman-DC" as early as 1940, and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption
of that name in 1977When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as science fiction,
Westerns, humor, and romance. DC also published crime and horror titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash
against such comics.</p>
